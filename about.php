  <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
  
  <p>To collect my thoughts I put together a rough page of examples. 
      I was interested in openings and texture more than font style, so they 
      all share the same basic copy, typeface, size, and leading (line height). 
      It was mostly for my own reference and will change over time, but 
      youâ€™re welcome to take a peek.</p>
